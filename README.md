# ML-Algorithm
Machine Learning Algorithms In Python

This project is a collection of commonly used machine learning algorithms implemented in Python. The algorithms include linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, K-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, Naive Bayes, gradient boosting, and neural networks.

The implementation of each algorithm includes a brief explanation of the theory behind it, as well as code and examples of how to use the algorithm. The code is easy to understand and well-commented, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced users.
